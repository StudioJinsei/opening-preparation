Elegant, sophisticated wordmark logo with only the text "StudioJinsei" - Website header version (1-line horizontal layout). Inspired by Francfranc's refined aesthetic. High-resolution PNG for web use.

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
- Text-only logo - NO taglines, NO subtitles, NO additional messages, ONLY "StudioJinsei"
- **EXACT SPELLING: "StudioJinsei" - capital S, capital J, all other letters lowercase - written as ONE WORD**
- **BACKGROUND MUST BE BEIGE (#F5F0E8 or #FAF7F2) - ABSOLUTELY NO GREEN BACKGROUND**
- **THIS DESIGN MUST MATCH THE STYLE OF THE 2-LINE VERSION - same font, same accent style, same overall aesthetic**

**Design Requirements:**
- Elegant wordmark logo with subtle geometric accents
- One-line horizontal layout: "StudioJinsei" written as one word
- Typography: Refined serif font OR elegant modern sans-serif (similar to Didot, Bodoni, or Optima)
- Sophisticated letterforms with good readability - NOT too thin
- Visual differentiation: "Studio" portion in regular weight (400-500), "Jinsei" portion in bold weight (700)
- **"Jinsei" portion should be THE DOMINANT FOCAL POINT - noticeably larger AND bolder**
- **CRITICAL: "Jinsei" should be significantly emphasized compared to "Studio"**
- Add subtle geometric accents: small dots, thin lines, or delicate shapes
- Optimized for horizontal website header format
- Must be highly legible at various sizes (from 32px to 200px height)
- Generous horizontal spacing and breathing room
- **High resolution: 4000px width minimum for web scalability**

**Layout Specifications:**
- Horizontal composition: **4000x1200px or larger for high-resolution web use**
- "StudioJinsei" as a single word with subtle weight variation
- Optional: Small geometric accent (dot, line, or arc) positioned tastefully near the wordmark
- Balanced horizontal composition
- Centered or left-aligned based on elegance
- Ample margins on all sides

**Color Scheme:**
- **Background: Warm light beige (#F5F0E8 or #FAF7F2) - ABSOLUTELY NO GREEN, NO MINT, NO TEAL background**
- **CRITICAL: Background MUST be beige/cream color, NOT white, NOT green**
- Text: Deep charcoal (#2C2C2C) for main text
- Geometric accent (if used): Soft mint green (#A8D5BA) - use ONLY for small accent elements, NOT for background
- Possible subtle variation: "Studio" portion slightly lighter (#8B8680)
- Total colors: 2-3 maximum
- NO corporate finance colors, NO typical banking aesthetics
- **VERIFY: The background should look like warm beige paper or cream surface**

**Style & Aesthetics:**
- Francfranc-inspired: elegant, refined, feminine yet professional
- Sophisticated boutique design studio aesthetic
- "Jinsei" portion must stand out clearly
- Extensive beige space - uncluttered and breathable
- Professional yet warm, approachable, and contemporary
- High attention to typographic details: kerning, letter spacing, balance
- Works perfectly in website headers, email signatures
- Subtle geometric elements enhance rather than distract

**Geometric Accents (use sparingly):**
- Small dots or circles positioned elegantly
- Delicate thin lines above, below, or alongside the wordmark
- Subtle arc or circular shapes
- Keep it minimal - one or two small accents maximum
- Should complement the typography, not overpower it

**Critical Constraints:**
- NO heavy decorative elements or ornaments
- NO symbols or icons
- NO taglines, subtitles, or additional text beyond "StudioJinsei"
- NO "Generated with..." or any other messages
- NO overly complex or baroque decorations
- NO gradient, heavy shadow, or 3D effects
- Keep it elegant and refined - sophistication over complexity

**Output Specifications:**
- Format: Horizontal layout, **high-resolution 4000x1200px minimum**
- Style: High-quality vector-like appearance, crisp edges
- Composition: Balanced horizontal layout with ample margins
- Final result: Elegant, sophisticated, memorable, timeless
- Should work well in website headers and wide banner contexts
- Optimized for web display with crisp rendering at various sizes
- Should feel like a premium boutique brand, not a corporate firm
