Elegant, sophisticated wordmark logo with only the text "StudioJinsei" - SNS icon version (2-line layout). Inspired by Francfranc's refined aesthetic.

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
- Text-only logo - NO taglines, NO subtitles, NO additional messages, ONLY "StudioJinsei"
- **EXACT SPELLING: "StudioJinsei" - capital S, capital J, all other letters lowercase**
- **BACKGROUND MUST BE BEIGE (#F5F0E8 or #FAF7F2) - ABSOLUTELY NO GREEN BACKGROUND**

**Design Requirements:**
- Elegant wordmark logo with subtle geometric accents
- Two-line vertical layout: "Studio" on top line, "Jinsei" on bottom line
- **IMPORTANT: Write exactly "Studio" and "Jinsei" with capital S and capital J only**
- **THIS DESIGN MUST MATCH THE STYLE OF THE 1-LINE VERSION - same font, same accent style, same overall aesthetic**
- Typography: Refined serif font OR elegant modern sans-serif (similar to Didot, Bodoni, or Optima)
- Sophisticated letterforms with good readability - NOT too thin
- "Studio" in regular weight (400-500), smaller size, graceful
- **"Jinsei" in bold weight (700), MUCH LARGER size - THE DOMINANT FOCAL POINT**
- **CRITICAL: "Jinsei" should be at least 1.5x to 2x the size of "Studio" and noticeably bolder**
- Add subtle geometric accents: small dots, thin lines, or delicate arc shapes around or near the text
- Optimized for square format (SNS profile icons)
- Must be highly legible at small sizes (64px-256px)
- Generous space - minimum 30% surrounding empty space

**Layout Specifications:**
- Square composition (1024x1024px)
- "Studio" centered at top, smaller and lighter, elegant
- "Jinsei" centered below, larger and more prominent
- Optional: Small geometric accent (dot, line, or arc) positioned tastefully
- Balanced vertical spacing between lines
- Centered alignment with ample breathing room

**Color Scheme:**
- **Background: Warm light beige (#F5F0E8 or #FAF7F2) - ABSOLUTELY NO GREEN, NO MINT, NO TEAL background**
- **CRITICAL: Background MUST be beige/cream color, NOT white, NOT green**
- Text: Deep charcoal (#2C2C2C) for main text
- Geometric accent (if used): Soft mint green (#A8D5BA) - use ONLY for small accent elements, NOT for background
- Total colors: 2-3 maximum
- NO corporate finance colors, NO typical banking aesthetics
- **VERIFY: The background should look like warm beige paper or cream surface**

**Style & Aesthetics:**
- Francfranc-inspired: elegant, refined, feminine yet professional
- Sophisticated boutique design studio aesthetic
- "Jinsei" must stand out clearly - larger size, refined letterforms
- Extensive beige space - uncluttered and breathable
- Professional yet warm, approachable, and contemporary
- High attention to typographic details: kerning, letter spacing, balance
- Subtle geometric elements enhance rather than distract

**Geometric Accents (use sparingly):**
- Small dots or circles positioned elegantly
- Delicate thin lines or underlines
- Subtle arc or circular shapes
- Keep it minimal - one or two small accents maximum
- Should complement the typography, not overpower it

**Critical Constraints:**
- NO heavy decorative elements or ornaments
- NO symbols or icons
- NO taglines, subtitles, or additional text beyond "StudioJinsei"
- NO "Generated with..." or any other messages
- NO overly complex or baroque decorations
- NO gradient, heavy shadow, or 3D effects
- Keep it elegant and refined - sophistication over complexity

**Output Specifications:**
- Format: Square 1024x1024px (optimized for SNS icons)
- Style: High-quality vector-like appearance, crisp edges
- Composition: Centered with ample margins
- Final result: Elegant, sophisticated, memorable, timeless
- Must work perfectly when scaled down to 256px or smaller
- Should feel like a premium boutique brand, not a corporate firm
