Recreate the provided reference image EXACTLY, but in 1-line horizontal layout, and change ONLY:
1. Capitalization: Change "STUDIO JINSEI" to "StudioJinsei"
2. Font weight: Slightly increase font weight
3. Layout: 1-line horizontal instead of 2-line vertical

**CRITICAL - FOLLOW EXACTLY:**
- **Use the EXACT SAME design style as the reference image**
- **ONLY change text to: "StudioJinsei" (written as ONE WORD)**
- **Capitalization: "StudioJinsei" = capital S, capital J, all others lowercase**
- **Font weight: Increase slightly from reference (make slightly bolder/heavier)**
- **Background: EXACTLY the same as reference image** (light beige/off-white)
- **Font style: EXACTLY the same as reference image** (modern sans-serif)
- **Overall aesthetic: EXACTLY the same as reference image**
- **Layout: Horizontal 1-line instead of vertical 2-line**

**DO NOT CHANGE:**
- Background color (keep same as reference)
- Font family/style (keep same as reference)
- Overall design aesthetic (keep same as reference)

**ONLY CHANGE:**
- Text from "STUDIO JINSEI" to "StudioJinsei"
- Font weight (make slightly heavier/bolder)
- Layout (horizontal 1-line instead of vertical 2-line)

**Output:**
- Horizontal layout, high-resolution (4000x1200px minimum)
- Clean, minimal design matching reference image style
- Only modifications: capitalization, font weight, and layout orientation
