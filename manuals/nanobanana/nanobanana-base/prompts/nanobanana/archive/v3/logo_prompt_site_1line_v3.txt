Create a minimalist, elegant logo design for "StudioJinsei" in 1-line horizontal layout.

REFERENCE DESIGN STYLE:
- Inspired by Francfranc, STEEN cafe, and Chii portfolio aesthetics
- Elegant, sophisticated, feminine yet professional
- Clean typography with subtle geometric accents
- Similar to the soft, minimalist Japanese design aesthetic

TEXT REQUIREMENTS (CRITICAL):
- Single line: "StudioJinsei" (capital S, capital J, all other letters lowercase)
- Font: MUST USE THE EXACT SAME FONT as the 2-line version
- Font weight: Medium to Semi-bold (500-600 weight) for readability - SAME as 2-line version
- Letter spacing: Comfortable, not too tight
- Emphasize "Jinsei" slightly more than "Studio" (could be through slight size difference or weight)

BACKGROUND:
- Soft light beige (#F5F0E8 or #FAF7F2)
- Clean, minimal, no texture
- ABSOLUTELY NO GREEN, NO MINT, NO TEAL
- SAME EXACT BACKGROUND COLOR as the 2-line version

DESIGN ELEMENTS:
- MUST USE THE EXACT SAME geometric accents as the 2-line version
- Subtle geometric accents: thin circles, lines, or minimal shapes around or near the text
- Think: delicate, refined, not heavy or busy
- Similar to how STEEN integrates geometric elements with typography
- Could include: a small circle accent, thin horizontal/vertical line, or simple frame element
- THE DESIGN STYLE MUST BE IDENTICAL to the 2-line version, just arranged horizontally

STYLE:
- Minimalist and elegant (Francfranc-inspired)
- Sophisticated, design-focused
- Readable but artistic
- Clean composition with balanced whitespace
- NOT corporate/banking style (avoid looking like Sumitomo Mitsui or Matsui Securities)
- THIS MUST LOOK LIKE THE SAME BRAND as the 2-line version

OUTPUT:
- Horizontal rectangular format suitable for website header
- High contrast between text and background for readability
- Professional quality, suitable for brand identity
- Can be used as website logo alongside the 2-line SNS icon version
