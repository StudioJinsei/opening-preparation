Create a minimalist, elegant logo design for "StudioJinsei" in 2-line layout.

REFERENCE DESIGN STYLE:
- Inspired by Francfranc, STEEN cafe, and Chii portfolio aesthetics
- Elegant, sophisticated, feminine yet professional
- Clean typography with subtle geometric accents
- Similar to the soft, minimalist Japanese design aesthetic

TEXT REQUIREMENTS (CRITICAL):
- Line 1: "Studio" (capital S, lowercase tudio)
- Line 2: "Jinsei" (capital J, lowercase insei)
- Font: Modern elegant sans-serif or refined serif
- Font weight: Medium to Semi-bold (500-600 weight) for readability
- Letter spacing: Comfortable, not too tight
- Emphasize "Jinsei" slightly more than "Studio"

BACKGROUND:
- Soft light beige (#F5F0E8 or #FAF7F2)
- Clean, minimal, no texture
- ABSOLUTELY NO GREEN, NO MINT, NO TEAL

DESIGN ELEMENTS:
- Subtle geometric accents: thin circles, lines, or minimal shapes around or near the text
- Think: delicate, refined, not heavy or busy
- Similar to how STEEN integrates geometric elements with typography
- Could include: a small circle accent, thin horizontal/vertical line, or simple frame element

STYLE:
- Minimalist and elegant (Francfranc-inspired)
- Sophisticated, design-focused
- Readable but artistic
- Clean composition with balanced whitespace
- NOT corporate/banking style (avoid looking like Sumitomo Mitsui or Matsui Securities)

OUTPUT:
- Square format (1:1 ratio) for SNS icon use
- High contrast between text and background for readability
- Professional quality, suitable for brand identity
