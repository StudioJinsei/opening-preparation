Professional minimalist wordmark logo for "StudioJinsei".

**Design Requirements:**
- Text-only design, absolutely no symbols, icons, or graphic elements
- Typography: Modern sans-serif, Poppins or similar clean, geometric font
- "Studio" in light/thin weight (300-400), "Jinsei" in medium/semibold weight (500-600)
- Strong visual hierarchy through font weight contrast and careful spacing
- Designed for versatility: optimized for both SNS icons (square) and website headers (horizontal)
- Must be highly legible at small sizes (64px) and large sizes (1024px+)
- Generous white space is essential - minimum 30% surrounding empty space

**Layout Variations:**
- Primary: Balanced square composition (for SNS icons)
- Alternative: Clean horizontal layout (for website header)
- Text can be stacked or side-by-side, but always with breathing room
- Consider subtle visual elements using negative space only

**Color Scheme:**
- Primary text: Dark teal (#1D4E4A) - main wordmark
- Accent: Soft mint green (#A8D5BA) - use sparingly (minimal geometric accent or subtle color variation only)
- NO partial underlines or underlines on specific syllables (like "sei" only) - avoid fragmented accents
- Background: Pure white (#FFFFFF) or transparent
- Keep total colors to 2-3 maximum for clarity

**Style & Aesthetics:**
- Ultra-minimalist, Apple-inspired clean aesthetic
- Clean, precise letterforms with generous letter spacing (tracking)
- Extensive white space - logo should feel uncluttered and open
- Modern, trustworthy, approachable, warm
- Professional yet personal, sophisticated yet friendly
- High attention to typographic details: kerning, alignment, balance

**Critical Constraints:**
- NO decorative elements, ornaments, or embellishments
- NO symbols, icons, badges, or graphic marks
- NO complicated ligatures, flourishes, or overly stylized fonts
- NO gradient, shadow, or 3D effects
- NO cluttered or crowded composition
- Keep it extremely simple - less is more

**Output Specifications:**
- Format: Square 1024x1024px (optimized for SNS icons and web use)
- Style: High-quality vector-like appearance, crisp edges
- Composition: Centered with ample margins, breathing room on all sides
- Final result: Clean, simple, memorable, timeless
- Must work perfectly when scaled down to 256px or smaller
