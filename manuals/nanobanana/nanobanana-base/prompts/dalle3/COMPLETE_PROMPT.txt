Professional minimalist wordmark logo for "StudioJinsei" with TWO layout variations.

**VERSION 1: Two-line stacked layout (Primary - optimized for SNS icons)**
- Line 1: "Studio" (light/thin weight 300-400, smaller size)
- Line 2: "Jinsei" (bold weight 600-700, LARGER - 1.5-2x size of Studio)
- Stack vertically with minimal line spacing
- Strong visual hierarchy - Jinsei clearly dominant
- Better visibility when scaled to small icons (128px or less)

**VERSION 2: One-line horizontal layout (Alternative - for website headers)**
- "Studio Jinsei" in one line
- "Studio" light/thin (300-400), "Jinsei" bold (600-700)
- Horizontal arrangement with careful letter spacing
- Maintains hierarchy through weight contrast

**Typography (for BOTH versions):**
- Modern sans-serif, Poppins or similar clean, geometric font
- High contrast between Studio (light) and Jinsei (bold)
- Generous letter spacing (tracking) for clarity
- Sharp, precise, clean letterforms
- Must be highly legible at small sizes (64px) and large sizes (1024px+)

**Emphasizing "Jinsei" (CRITICAL):**
- Size: Jinsei noticeably LARGER than Studio (especially in stacked version)
- Weight: Jinsei significantly BOLDER (600-700 vs 300-400)
- Color option: Jinsei can use slightly richer/darker teal shade
- Integrated accent: Soft mint green (#A8D5BA) accent if used must feel natural:
  - Small geometric element (dot, minimal line) beside or near Jinsei
  - OR subtle color highlight on specific letter
  - Must NOT float disconnected - should feel cohesive
  - NO separate underlines that appear floating

**Layout & Spacing:**
- Square composition 1024x1024px (primary)
- Generous white space is essential - minimum 30-35% surrounding empty space
- Centered with ample margins, breathing room on all sides
- Well-balanced, professional composition

**Color Scheme:**
- Primary text: Dark teal (#1D4E4A)
- Jinsei emphasis: Can use slightly richer/darker teal
- Accent: Soft mint green (#A8D5BA) - use sparingly, integrated, NOT floating
- Background: Pure white (#FFFFFF) or transparent
- Keep total colors to 2-3 maximum for clarity

**Style & Aesthetics:**
- Ultra-minimalist, Apple-inspired clean aesthetic
- Clean, precise letterforms with generous letter spacing (tracking)
- Extensive white space - logo should feel uncluttered and open
- Modern, trustworthy, approachable, warm
- Professional yet personal, sophisticated yet friendly
- High attention to typographic details: kerning, alignment, balance

**Critical Constraints:**
- NO decorative elements, ornaments, or embellishments
- NO symbols, icons, badges, or graphic marks
- NO floating/disconnected underlines or accents
- NO complicated ligatures, flourishes, or overly stylized fonts
- NO gradient, shadow, or 3D effects
- NO cluttered or crowded composition
- Text only, extremely simple - less is more
- Any accent must feel integrated and natural, NOT separate or floating

**Output Specifications:**
- Format: Square 1024x1024px (optimized for SNS icons and web use)
- Style: High-quality vector-like appearance, crisp edges
- Composition: Centered with ample margins, breathing room on all sides
- Final result: Clean, simple, memorable, timeless
- Must work perfectly when scaled down to 128px or smaller (especially VERSION 1)
- High visibility and readability even at small icon sizes

**Deliverables:**
- VERSION 1: Two-line stacked (Studio / Jinsei) - Primary for SNS
- VERSION 2: One-line horizontal (Studio Jinsei) - Alternative for web
