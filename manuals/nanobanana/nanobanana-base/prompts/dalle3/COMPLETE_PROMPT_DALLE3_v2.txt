Create a minimalist text-only logo for "StudioJinsei" with TWO layout variations.

**VERSION 1: Two-line stacked layout (Primary - for SNS icons)**
- Line 1: "Studio" (thin/light weight, smaller)
- Line 2: "Jinsei" (medium/bold weight, LARGER and more prominent)
- Jinsei should be 1.5-2x larger than Studio
- Stack vertically with minimal space between lines
- Better visibility when scaled down to small icons

**VERSION 2: One-line horizontal layout (Alternative - for website)**
- "Studio Jinsei" in one line
- "Studio" thin, "Jinsei" bold
- Horizontal arrangement with careful spacing

**Typography for BOTH versions:**
- Modern sans-serif font (Poppins-style, clean geometric)
- High contrast between Studio (light 300-400) and Jinsei (bold 600-700)
- Generous letter spacing for clarity at small sizes
- Sharp, crisp letterforms

**Emphasizing "Jinsei" (IMPORTANT):**
- Make Jinsei NOTICEABLY larger/bolder than Studio
- Option 1: Use slightly darker/richer dark teal for Jinsei only
- Option 2: Add subtle soft mint green (#A8D5BA) accent - NOT as underline but as:
  - Small geometric element beside Jinsei (dot, short line)
  - OR subtle color tint on one letter
  - Must feel integrated, not floating or disconnected

**Colors:**
- Primary text: Dark teal (#1D4E4A)
- Jinsei can be slightly darker/richer teal for emphasis
- Accent (if used): Soft mint green (#A8D5BA) - minimal, integrated
- Background: Pure white (#FFFFFF)

**Layout & Spacing:**
- Square composition 1024x1024px
- GENEROUS white space (30-35% minimum)
- Well-balanced, centered
- High visibility even at 128px or smaller

**Style:**
- Ultra-minimalist, Apple-inspired aesthetic
- Professional yet approachable and warm
- Clean, precise, sophisticated
- Strong visual hierarchy (Jinsei clearly dominant)

**Critical constraints:**
- NO floating/disconnected underlines
- NO symbols or icons
- NO gradients or 3D effects
- Text only, extremely clean
- Any accent must feel natural and integrated

Create BOTH versions so we can compare for different use cases.
